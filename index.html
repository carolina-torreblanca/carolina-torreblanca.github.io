	<p> ¡Hola! I'm a Postdoctoral Fellow at the <a href="https://pdri-devlab.upenn.edu/">Penn Development Research Initiative.</a> I received my Ph.D. in Politics from <a href="nyu.edu">New York University in 2024</a>.</p>
	<p> My research explores the political economy of crime and its punishment, with a regional focus on Mexico and Latin America and an emphasis on political methodology.</p>
	<p> I hold a B.A. in Political Science and a B.A. in International Relations from ITAM (2015). Before coming to NYU, I was the Director of Data Analysis in <a href="https://datacivica.org/">Data Cívica</a>.</p>
	<p> If you want to read my rants about Mexican politics and occasionally movies, you can <a href="https://twitter.com/caro_whitetower">follow me on Twitter</a>. I am also working on an ever-expanding compilation of <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4Al9JKnrYCCIZKlYyR70ku?si=63d507000c5846ce">the best cover songs</a> you can check out.</p>
