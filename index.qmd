<p>¡Hola! I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at <a href="https://pdri-devlab.upenn.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PDRI-DevLab</a> at the University of Pennsylvania. My research explores the political economy of crime and its punishment, with a regional focus on Mexico and Latin America and an emphasis on political methodology. Additionally, I work on the epistemology of causal research, exploring what conclusions we can draw from diverse research designs.</p>
