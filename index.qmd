<p>¡Hola! I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at <a href="https://pdri-devlab.upenn.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PDRI-DevLab</a> at the University of Pennsylvania. I am also a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the <a href="https://web.sas.upenn.edu/data-science/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Data Driven Discovery Initiative (DDDI)</a> at the University of Pennsylvania and an external Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the <a href="https://povgov.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Poverty, Violence and Governance Lab</a> at Stanford University.</p>

<p>My research sits at the intersection of comparative political economy and political methodology, with a substantive focus on violence in Latin America. In my substantive work, I demonstrate that the political consequences of violence are contingent on institutional arrangements and social inequalities that determine who receives protection, how citizens experience state security efforts, and how they can respond politically to failures in its provision. My substantive interests have led me to identify and address methodological challenges about causal inference
under heterogeneous treatment effects.
