<p>¡Hola! I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at <a href="https://pdri-devlab.upenn.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PDRI-DevLab</a> at the University of Pennsylvania. I am also an incoming Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the <a href="https://web.sas.upenn.edu/data-science/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Data Driven Discovery Initiative (DDDI)</a> at the University of Pennsylvania and an external Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the <a href="https://povgov.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Poverty, Violence and Governance Lab</a> at Stanford University.</p>

<p>My research sits at the intersection of comparative political economy and political methodology. In my substantive work, I examine how institutional arrangements determine who is vulnerable to violence, how citizens interpret their experiences with state security provision, and how they can respond politically to failures and inequalities in protection. To understand how violence changes political participation, I develop methodological tools that clarify how estimand choice incorporates heterogeneity in treatment effects and exposure, and what this means for understanding real-world changes in political outcomes.</p>
