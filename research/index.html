		<p>"Class and the Development of Trust in Police in Latin America</p>
		<p align="justify" style="font-size: 16px"><b>Abstract.</b> In the United States, trust in police is positively correlated with socio-economic status. We show that this is not the case in Latin America. In 147 surveys spanning 20 Latin American countries, we find that trust in police is weakly negatively correlated with socio-economic status—a fact that neither regional experts nor subject-matter experts anticipated. By way of explanation, we propose that rich people everywhere are more likely to interpret everyday experiences as signals about the police. Because bad experiences like crime victimization and bribe solicitation are more common in Latin America than in the US, rich people’s tendency to interpret poor security outcomes as signals of police (un)trustworthiness should lead to a lower trust–SES gradient in Latin America relative to the US. In our account, cross-country differences in the trust–SES gradient are driven not by cross-country differences in how people update but rather by cross-country differences in policing outcomes, together with universal class-based differences in people’s readiness to see the world around them as a signal about police.</a></p>

	<p>"The Political Consequences of Crime Victimization Reconsidered"</p>
	<p align="justify" style="font-size: 16px"><b>Abstract.</b> Extant work on the political consequences of victimization finds that crime politicizes. In this paper, I argue that interpreting such findings as causal requires the implausible assumption that crime is (conditionally) exogenous from political outcomes. Conversely, I recast victimization as the result of an endogenous selection process driven by politics that produces victims and non- victims who differ in beliefs and preferences before victimization. I look for and discover evidence of political selection into victimization in canonical results, finding residualized participation is systematically related to victimization even after parsing out treatment and individual-level covariates. Additionally, I leverage seven years of a unique rotating panel survey from Mexican cities and show that crime victims behaved differently before victimization in ways that are systematically related to their politics; they were less trusting, more active, interacted more often with state agents, and were more exposed to crime and conflict than their never-victim neighbors. Results suggest that victimization might politicize, but only the previously political</a></p>
